# Who am I?
I am a PhD candidate at Duke University, majoring in electrical and computer engineering. 
I power through boundaries of electronics to advance cutting-edge neuroscience research. 

# What do I do?
I am currently developing a closed-loop brain stimulation platform that offers unparalleled flexibility in brain stimulation paradigms, including pulse shape, timing, and stimulation sequences. Collaborating with a team at Duke's Psychiatry Department, our goal is to identify more efficient stimulation patterns using this innovative platform.

# What is the state of my career?
I am seeking a summer internship for 2025, as well as long-term job opportunities. 
I specialize in power electronics, particularly for large-scale systems, and am a dedicated embedded systems developer. 
I am a lifelong learner, continually growing from all experiences, especially failures.
